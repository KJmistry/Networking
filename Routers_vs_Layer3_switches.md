# Layer-3 Switch (Multilayer switch)

- Combines the functionality of a switch and a router. Designed to handle large amounts of network traffic and can perform packet forwarding at high speeds.
- It uses specialized hardware, such as application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs) and field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs), to perform routing and switching functions more efficiently than a general-purpose CPU-based router.
- They are particularly useful in large networks where high-speed packet forwarding is required, as they can perform this function more efficiently than a traditional router.
- It can perform routing functions at wire speed, without introducing additional latency or network congestion.

# Router Vs Layer-3 Switch

- Routers are dedicated devices that are designed specifically to perform routing functions.
They use software-based routing algorithms to determine the best path for forwarding packets between networks.  
Layer-3 switches, on the other hand, are designed to combine the functionality of a switch and a router. 
They use hardware-based routing algorithms to perform packet forwarding more efficiently than a general-purpose CPU-based router.
-  Layer-3 switches can perform packet forwarding at very high speeds, making them ideal for use in high-speed LAN environments.  
Routers, on the other hand, are typically slower than layer-3 switches and are better suited for WAN environments.
- Routers typically offer more advanced features, such as VPN support, firewalling, and NAT.  
Layer-3 switches may offer some of these features, but they are typically more limited in scope.
